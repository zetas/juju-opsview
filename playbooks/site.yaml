# The tasks here are left as examples and should be removed/replaced by the
# charm author. Some things to note:
# 1. All charm config values are available as template variables
#    e.g. repo -> {{repo}}, app-name -> {{app_name}} (note underscore)
# 2. Along with charm config values, the following variables are also
#    made available as template vars:
#    charm_dir
#    local_unit
#    unit_private_address
#    unit_public_address
# 3. Use tags to control when each task is executed. The tags list should
#    contain one or more hook names.
